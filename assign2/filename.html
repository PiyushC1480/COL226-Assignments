 <h5>Assignment: MDT: A translator from Markdown--  to HTML text with tables</h5> 
 </center> 
 </p> 
 <h6>Introduction</h6> 
 <p> 
 HTML is often too verbose and complicated for most static pages like this 
 one. Most writers of web-pages require only the simplest HTML mark-ups 
 with the fewest possible options and even fewer special symbols. For 
 such simple web-pages it suffices to use a few simple symbols to 
 format the text written in a text editor (such as <i>gedit</i>, <i>Emacs</i> or even 
 <i>notepad</i>) as an HTML document. 
 </p> 
 These considerations led to the design of <i>[markdown][jg]</i> which is a simple 
 program that converts text into HTML with a minimum number of \"markup\" 
 symbols. There are now several versions with various sophisticated 
 features that can do most things such as convert the markdown file 
 into HTML or LaTex or even directly into pdf. 
 <p> 
 The original markdown did not support HTML tables. So we add that as 
 an essential feature with its own markdown syntax along with some more 
 simplifications by stripping down and changing some functionalities.  
 </p> 
 <h5>Markdown--: Essentials</h5> 
 <p> 
 <ol> 
 <li> 
  This HTML file <tt>mdtab-2023.md.html</tt> was produced by running 
 [markdown] [jg] on the text file <tt>mdtab-2023.md</tt>. 
 Use the [text][md] file to test your own program. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  To know about markdown go to the [markdown syntax][jg] 
 page maintained by John Gruber. Many of the simplifications listed 
 below also refer to Gruber's document.  
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  Recognize and leave all inline HTML tags unchanged. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  <b>Headings.</b> Do not implement the underlining feature of  
 markdown. Implement only the headings defined by hashes.  
 Hence you must implement the 6 levels of headings which  
 are the levels shown in 
 the centered lines at the beginning of this document. The 
 number of hashes at the beginning of the line indicates the  
 heading level. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  Implement the following for pure text elements --  
 Use of double asterisks for <b>bolding</b> and single asterisks for 
 <i>italics</i>. 
 There is nothing in markdown for underlining -- under-scores are 
 used for italics and bolding as an alternative to 
 asterisks. Instead implement underlining as follows. 
 Example: \"\\<u> underlined\\ text\\ \" </u> produces <u>underlined text</u>). 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  <b>Horizontal Ruling</b>. Implement only the code corresponding to 
 the use of at least 3 consecutive hypens (---) to produce 
 a horizontal line. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  <b>Block quotes.</b> Implement only the email-style block-quoting 
 (i.e. every line in a block quote should begin with >,  
 otherwise it is not a block quote) along with the nested 
 block-quoting. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  <b>Links.</b> Implement the direct href produced by the 
 using the \"\\[text\\]\\(http://url/of/the/link\\)\" syntax. Also implement the 
 automatic links feature e.g. 
 <code> 
 code<http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sak> 
 </code> 
 renders as <a href =http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sak>http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sak</a> which 
 provides the URL and the link to the URL. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  <b>Lists.</b> Implement  
 </li> 
  
 <ul> 
 <li> 
  <i>ordered lists</i> -- as given by [John Gruber] [jg]. Pay particular  
 attention to his 1986 example relating to escape sequencing the 
 \".\" in case 1986 comes at the beginning of a line. 
 </li> 
 <li> 
  <i>unordered lists</i> -- implement only the hyphen (as done here). 
 </li> 
  
 </ul> 
 <li> 
  Implement tables from csv format. Make the simplifying assumption that a HTML table is always 
 centered. For example the following is 
 <center> <table border = 1> 
 <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 9 </td> </tr> 
 <tr> <td> 5 </td> <td> 6 </td> <td> 7 </td> <td> 8 </td> <td> 10 </td> </tr> 
 <tr> <td> 11 </td> <td> 12 </td> <td> 13 </td> <td> 14 </td> <td> 15 </td> </tr> 
 </table></center> 
 a possible syntax for an HTML table that looks like 
 </li> 
  
 </ol> 
 <CENTER><TABLE border=\"1\"> 
 <TR><TD>1</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>3</TD><TD>4</TD><TD>9</TD></TR> 
 <TR><TD>5</TD><TD>6</TD><TD>7</TD><TD>8</TD><TD>10</TD></TR> 
 <TR><TD>11</TD><TD>12</TD><TD>13</TD><TD>14</TD><TD>15</TD></TR> 
 </TABLE></CENTER> 
 </p> 
 \t 
 <h5>What you need to do.</h5> 
 <p> 
 Write a SML function <tt>mdt2html</tt> which takes a single input text 
 file <i>filename</i>.<tt>mdt</tt> and translates it into a HTML file 
 <i>filename</i>.<tt>html</tt> that may be viewed on any browser. Your SML file 
 should be called <tt>mdt2html.sml</tt> 
 </p> 
 You may use all the functionalities given in the <tt>TextIO</tt> and 
 the <tt>String</tt> modules of 
 SML. While this requires using some of the impure features of SML, 
 your primary focus should be on not using the imperative constructs of 
 SML -- such as loops and assignment -- unless absolutely essential. 
 <p> 
 <h5>Note:</h5> 
 </p> 
 <p> 
 <ol> 
 <li> 
  Since the above description is as clear as I can possibly make it, If you 
 still have some doubts, <font color=red>make reasonable design 
 decisions</font> and explicitly state them in a <tt>README.mdt</tt> 
 to be submitted along with your code. 
 \t 
 <li> 
  Upload and submit a single zip file called <i>entryno</i><tt>.zip</tt> 
 where <i>entryno</i> is your entry number. This file should contain the 
 two files <tt>mdt2html.sml</tt> and <tt>README.mdt</tt>. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  You are <u> not  </u>  allowed to change any of the names 
 or types given in the specification/signature. You are not even 
 allowed to change upper-case letters to lower-case letters or 
 vice-versa. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  The evaluator may use automatic scripts to evaluate the 
 assignments (especially when the number of submissions is large) and 
 penalise you for deviating from the instructions. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  You may define any new auxiliary functions/predicates you like in your code 
 besides those mentioned in the specification. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  Your program should implement the given specifications/signature. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  You need to think of the <i>most efficient</i> way of 
 implementing the various functions in a <i>functional</i> style given in the 
 specification/signature so that the function results satisfy their 
 definitions and properties. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  In a large class or in a large assignment, it is not always 
 possible to specify every single design detail and clear each and every 
 doubt. So you need to submit a <tt>README.mdt</tt> file containing 
 </li> 
  
 <ul> 
 <li> 
  all the decisions (they could be design decisions or 
 resolution of ambiguities present in the assignment) that you have 
 taken in order to solve the problem. Whether your decision is 
 ``reasonable'' will be evaluated by the evaluator of the 
 assignment. 
 \t 
 </li> 
 <li> 
  a description of  which code you have 
 ``borrowed'' from various sources, along with the identity of the 
 source. 
 \t 
 </li> 
 <li> 
  all sources that you have consulted in solving the assignment. 
 </li> 
  
 </li> 
 <li> 
  name changes or signature changes if any, along with a full 
 justification of why that was necessary. 
 </li> 
  
 </ul> 
 <li> 
  The evaluator may look at your source code before evaluating it, 
 you must explain your algorithms in the form of comments, so that 
 the evaluator can understand what you have implemented. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  Do <u> not  </u> add any more decorations or functions or 
 user-interfaces in order to impress the evaluator of the program. 
 Nobody is going to be impressed by it. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  There is a serious penalty for code similarity (similarity goes 
 \tmuch deeper than variable names, indentation and line numbering). If 
 \tit is felt that there is too much similarity in the code between any 
 \ttwo persons, then both are going to be penalized equally. So please 
 \tset permissions on your directories, so that others have no access 
 \tto your programs. 
 </li> 
  
 <li> 
  To reduce penalties, a clear section called  
 \t<b>Acknowledgements</b> giving a detailed list of what you copied from 
 \twhere or whom may be included in the <tt>README.mdt</tt> file.
